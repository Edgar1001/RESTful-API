For the Route D, I have used curl command to add two different ratings to the same Song_id, 
this way for the Route E later on, average is made taking into account these two different ratings.


curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/rate -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d '{"song_id": "67063c9bc35055097b4f78c0", "rating": 5}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/rate -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
-d '{"song_id": "67063c9bc35055097b4f78c0", "rating": 1}'
